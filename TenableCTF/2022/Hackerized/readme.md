# Hackerized

We are given a string with weird UTF characters.
I noticed that it looks like a intense leet code.
After decoding the leet code and several trials and error, I was able to get the flag.

(Unfortunately I don't have access to the challenges anymore, so I cannot give you the exact flag. I will make notes of the challenges for the next CTF)
