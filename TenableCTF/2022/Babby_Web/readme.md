# Babby Web 1-4

The Babby Web challenge consists of 4 flags that are hidden in a single website.

The first flag can be found in the source code of the website, commented out.
The second flag can be found in the certificates.
The third flag can be found in the robots.txt.
The final flag was found by running nikto onto the host (I hope this wasn't prohibited)
