### Prompt

```
OMG, the LIT Music Bot is playing my favorite song on the voice channel! Why does it sound a bit off tho?
```

### Solution

Listening to the LIT Music Bot, it is playing "Never Gonna Give you up" on repeat, except there's some noise.
This is a morse with the longer noise being "\_", shorter noise being ".", and the woodblock sound being " ".
