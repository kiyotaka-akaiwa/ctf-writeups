### Prompt
```
We've been rummaging through a Person of Interest's wheelie bins. We've found this boarding pass; although it looks like whoever had it was a bit paranoid that someone like us would find it.

I think we can still do something with this though... There is one thing in particular on here that may help us.

We really need to find the SEAT NUMBER of this person, in order to connect it with other evidence the team has gathered.

We've attached the boarding pass for you. Please find this out for us.

### Solution
The attachment is an image of a flight ticket.
I found this article regarding flight ticket barcode (https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/10/whats-in-a-boarding-pass-barcode-a-lot/).
I used the barcode reader found in the article (https://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com/default.aspx).
Uploading the image, I was able to decode the image and get the seat number.

`Sarah, Luxton - LHR to CDG - BA304 - SEAT NUMBER: 22B`

**Flag**: 22B
