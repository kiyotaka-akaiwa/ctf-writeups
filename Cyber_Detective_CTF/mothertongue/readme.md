### Prompt
```
One of our linguists has found a strange email between two targets, it seems to be some kind of foreign script.

We can't make sense of it, find whatever is lurking in there? It could be big or small. It could be meaningful or meaningless. But its there.

### Solution
The pastebin contains a text written in a foreign language.
Using Google Translate's auto-detect feature, we find that the text says "Speaking multiple languages is an interesting thing" in Pashto.
However, we find multiple text written in another languages. 
Most of these, when translated using Google Translate, translates to "The flag is here somewhere," except one of them.

`Булут`

The word above translates to "cloud" in Kyrgy, which ended up being the flag.

**Flag**: cloud
