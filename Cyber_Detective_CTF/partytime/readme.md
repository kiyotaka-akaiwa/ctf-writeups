# partytime

### Prompt
```
Our intelligence analysts have reported that a whole bunch of our targets are having a party together on a Saturday night soon.

We want to deploy agents to see whats going on, but we can't risk blowing our cover turning up in a car. The road is pretty quiet and the property has very clear view of its surroundings, our reports suggest.

Find the location of the party and the best BUS ROUTE NUMBER to reach the party from Principality Stadium, Cardiff - where the surveillance team will be deployed from.

This sounds silly but we need to blend in with the public. The stakes are high.

Enter the BUS ROUTE NUMBER you think is best for this situation.

NOTE: If you're having trouble working out who these people are, have a look at other Life Online challenges as they could provide you with an entry point to find these people ;).

### Solution
A Tweet by Pearce contains the address for the party (https://twitter.com/PearceRees/status/1227617292680298500).

`159 Llanedeyrn Rd
Cardiff
