Where did James spend his childhood?
```

### Solution
We are given a URL to a Twitter account.
The Twitter account bio says:

`Born in ///purple.pulse.force, raised in ///push.asking.barn.`

I searched on google "push asking barn" without the quotation marks.
Although most of the results were the answer for this challenge, the first result was a link to a website what3words.com
This website seems to be used to easily share location using 3 words combination. 
Searching for "///push.asking.barn" in this website resulted in York, New Hampshire.

**Flag**: York
