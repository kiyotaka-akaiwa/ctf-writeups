### Prompt
```
We've been watching a bloke called George recently, you might have already done some work on him.

He's not that smart by the looks of things, could be a good person to look for a social media presence on.

In particular, we're after an access key for a program his company uses so that the team can ex-filtrate information to aid with our ongoing fraud investigations.

NOTE: If you're having trouble working out who this person is, have a look at other Life Online challenges as they could provide you with an entry point to find these people ;).

Let us know when you've found it...
```
