### Prompt
```
We've become aware of a particular uber-rich foreign multi-billionaire systematically purchasing properties en masse from British businesses for prices they cannot refuse.

It isn't unusual for businesses to remortgage some of their properties in order to secure a low-cost cash advance, but our intelligence suggests that our target has paid well over the odds for the properties they've recently bought.

This strikes us as very unusual as intuitively, it seems like a complete waste of money. We are concerned that there may be nefarious objectives held by this individual; perhaps to gain control over how much businesses pay for the newly-owed rent of the stores/branches in which they operate and cannot afford to lose.

We've seen instances such as this in the past - well funded parties using their wealth as leverage to essentially hold firms to ransom by driving up rental costs. It is feared that this trend will leave many significant players within the British economy susceptible to blackmail and manipulation or be forced to downscale to absorb the price hikes.

We must act; the UK economy could be on a collision course to disaster. This is particularly dangerous as not only does it place power in the hands of potential adversaries, but also artificially inflates the profits of companies.

I've attached a bank statement we secured after infiltrating the target's personal holdings company network. It shows the sum paid for the property and the date of the purchase.

We know there is publicly searchable data made available by the Land Registry which could help us with what we're after.

We must start gauging the risk to each business that this individual has acquired property from.

Can you find out the BUSINESS NAME of the previous owner of the property that can be inferred from the seized bank statement?

NOTE: You only have three attempts so don't just guess! ;)

### Solution
The prompt hints us that we can use the government official land registry to search for property transactions.
I used https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd/ to search for transactions with the given price and date in the PDF.
This gave me 1 result, which ended up being the correct one.
