### Prompt
```
We're trying to plan when is best to break into James' house to plant a bug.

What time does he start work? (UK time).

NOTE: If you're having trouble working out who this person is, have a look at other Life Online challenges as they could provide you with an entry point to find these people ;).
```

### Solution
In James' Twitter account, he Tweeted he just finished his 8 hours work (https://twitter.com/jammymarkson/status/1226989808783888384).
Because this was posted at 10:02 PM UK Time, we can subtract 8 hours to find the starting time.

**Flag**: 2:00
