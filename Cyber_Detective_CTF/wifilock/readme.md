```
Your wifi box at home uses it to stop nosy neighbors from trying to steal your internet connection so they don't have to pay for their own.

It can even stop someone from parking outside your house and hoovering up all of that sensitive data flying through the air.

Its the worlds most popular way to protect a wireless access point, but what acronym is it known by?
```

### Solution
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a standard for Wi-Fi security. The latest is WPA3, although WPA2 is still the most prevalent

**Flag**: WPA2
