### Prompt
```
We have reason to believe that a particular company, TECHNOLOGY SERVICES LIMITED is complicit in a case we are investigating.

To gain a better understanding of the size and scale of this company, we need you to find out the AMOUNT OF CASH currently held by them.

We've attached a document we acquired from hacking one of their laptops; hopefully this will help you find this information?

Thank you for your continued support.

E.g. if the AMOUNT OF CASH was Â£94,200, for the flag you'd enter: 94.2
```

### Solution
We are given a PDF that includes the company number we are interested in.

`01867162`

Searching the number on Google, I found this website (http://www.checkcompany.co.uk/company/01867162/TECHNOLOGY-SERVICES-LIMITED).
I tried inputting all the numbers under assets, and one of them worked.

**Flag**: 102.347
