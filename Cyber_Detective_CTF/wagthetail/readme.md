### Prompt
```
The team has been trying to work out where Person of Interest, Sarah, walks her dog. This is part of building up a profile of her movements.

Can you have a look to see if you can find the TOWN in which Sarah tends to take the dog out to?

NOTE: If you're having trouble working out who this person is, have a look at other Life Online challenges as they could provide you with an entry point to find these people ;).
```

### Solution
In Sarah's Twitter Account (https://twitter.com/sarah_luxton) is a coordinate.

`51.947528, -3.393953`

Assuming Buster is her dog, the location of this coordinate is most likely where she take her dog for walk.
A google search of the location results in Brecon, United Kingdom.
