### Prompt
```
We obtained an enforcement order on one of our high priority targets' email account.

They have been sending mysterious e-mails to an associate with no subject and no message, although there is an obscure stock image from the internet attached to each e-mail we've seen.

We suspect they are using steganography to obfuscate (hide) meaningful information within the otherwise insignificant image attachments.

Surveilling the target's laptop use in Starbucks via shoulder surfing has revealed that they use Stegosaurus, a bespoke online steganography tool.

We've attached an image file from an e-mail that we believe has had something encoded into it by the target. The idea behind steganography is to implant something and not make it obvious to the naked eye (or ear).

Please tell us what the HIDDEN MESSAGE within the specimen image provided is.
